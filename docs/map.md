# Project map

Where things are in Pi Pocket, for agents working on it. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) has the rules for editing it while it runs; [architecture.md](architecture.md) explains how the parts depend on each other and the orderings they rely on; [features.md](features.md) says what each feature does.

## Processes

`bin/pi-pocket.js` checks Node, then runs `src/launcher/main.ts`. The launcher reads its options (`options.ts`), asks how devices connect (`access.ts`: this device, LAN, Cloudflare quick tunnel, Tailscale), runs the server (`src/server/main.ts`) as a child, restarts it on exit code 75 or a crash, and keeps the tunnel up. `term.ts` draws its menu, panel, and QR code in the terminal. The server takes the data folder's lock, opens one `PocketApp`, and serves it with `http.ts`.

## Data (`~/.pi-pocket/`, or `PI_POCKET_DIR`)

- `pocket.sqlite`: Pi Durable's storage: conversations, entries, tasks, and Pi Pocket's documents.
- `config.json`: people, roles, hashed tokens, settings. `push.json`: VAPID keys and push subscriptions.
- `uploads/<conversation>/`, `worktrees/` (sessions' git worktrees), `extensions/` (the owner's drop-ins), `browser/profile/` (the built-in browser's profile; each session's cookies live in memory only).

## Server: `src/server/`

A module split into parts keeps its name for the part others import, with the rest in a folder of the same name beside it (`http.ts` and `http/`, `browser.ts` and `browser/`). Modules import what they use from the module that owns it; there are no barrels. `PocketApp` creates the app's parts and hands each one the app; callers use them as fields (`app.workspace.viewFile(…)`, `app.attribution.requesterOf(…)`).

| `main.ts`               | The server process: options, the port, signals, then `PocketApp.open` and `createHandler`                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `app.ts`                | `PocketApp`: opening the harness, reading state back at startup (`#recover`), the commit coordinator (`#committed`), connected tabs and their peek tiles, access checks (`canSee`, `requireSteer`, `requireDriver`), the session list, `hello`, extensions on and off |
| `attribution.ts`        | Who Pi works for: who wrote each message to Pi or whose work it is (authors documents, from request ids), who queued each submission; read back at startup                                                                                                            |

| `entry-format.ts`       | The kinds of Pi Pocket's own entries, and the markers it writes into message text (`[from: …]`, attached files). Stored data and the web app depend on their exact values                                                                                             |

## Extensions: `src/server/extensions/`

Each default-exports `(host: PocketHost) => Extension | Extension[]` and is installed in this order: `prompt` (system prompt), `artifacts` (artifact tool), `browser` (browser tool and its prompt section; through `host.browsers`), `subagents` (subagent tool and its tasks), `schedules` (schedule tool; installs the schedule task), `goals` (hook after each answer), `plan` (tool hook and prompt section), `guard` (tool hook that asks for approval), `codemode` (codemode tool; a script's calls go through the same hooks).

## Web: `web/` (Preact and htm, no build)

Plain ES modules, loaded as they are. `store.js` holds the shared state, and nothing imports in a circle. Some modules do work when they load: `store.js`, `ui.js` (Markdown and sanitizer setup, document listeners), `theme.js` (the saved appearance, which `prefs()` reads), `peeks.js`, `browser-panel.js` and `files-panel.js` (the panels' saved widths), `rich.js` (gives `Markdown` its rich block), and `app.js`. `store.set` calls subscribers in the order they subscribed, so keep the order in which modules load when moving code between them.

## How a message travels

1. `POST /api/c/:id/submit` → `commands.submit`: checks access, turns, and spend, expands a template, then `conversation.submit()` with request id `u:<userId>:<clientId>`. The request id makes a retry a no-op and names the author.
2. Pi Durable runs the generation and tool tasks, committing each step to `pocket.sqlite`. Extension hooks run inside those tasks.
3. `app.ts`'s commit coordinator (`#committed`) hears every commit: spend counts usage first, then each document change updates what the app keeps in memory and the rooms that show it, and `attribution.ts` notes who each message is for.
4. Each room sends its tabs what changed. `store.js` applies it, and Preact renders.

## Adding things

- **A document:** define it in `docs.ts`. To show it live, add it to `ROOM_DOCS` and the view in `room.ts`, and read it in `store.js`.
- **A command:** a method in `commands.ts` (check access first), a route in `http/conversation-routes.ts` (or `http/api.ts` for one that is not about a conversation), an action in `store.js`, then the UI.
- **A sheet:** a component in `web/sheets/`, a case in `sheetBody` (`web/sheets.js`), and `openSheet({ type })` where it opens.
- **A built-in extension:** a file in `extensions/`, its place in `ORDER` and its title in `TITLES` (`reload.ts`), and the order asserted in `test/app.test.ts`.
- **A slash command:** `web/commands.js`.

## Rules that are easy to break

- Browsers only see committed state. Nothing is shown before it is stored.
- Document kinds, scopes, and fork settings are stored data: never change them.
- Hooks get only `memo` and `snapshot`. Anything a replay must not repeat goes in a memo or behind an idempotent request id.
- Whose work Pi does comes from request ids (`requests.ts`): a message sent for someone needs their id in its request id; one without it leaves Pi working for whoever it worked for before. At startup, what a crash kept out of the authors document is read back from Pi Durable's records.
- A tool is `replay: "safe"` only if running it twice is harmless.
- Extensions reach the app only through `PocketHost`.
- Server code is erasable TypeScript with `.ts` imports. Comments are plain sentences.

## Tests: `test/`

`npm test` runs every `*.test.ts` with Node's test runner. `helpers.ts` provides a scripted model (`scriptedModel(route)`: `faux-1`, `faux-2`, `faux-vision`), `openApp` (the same data folder again is a restart; `now` moves the clock), `newSession`, `say`, `until`, and `fakeTab`. The scripted model costs nothing: spend tests write `pi.usage` themselves. `browser.test.ts` drives a real Chromium, where one is installed, for the built-in browser, and `peeks-ui.test.ts` loads the whole web app in it and tests peek tiles there. The rest of the web app has no tests: check a change to it in a browser.
